# Web Typography Class

**[Check out the wiki for a detailed class curriculum](https://github.com/scottkellum/web-typography-class/wiki)**

This is the repo for [Scott Kellumâ€™s](https://scottkellum.com) _[Typography on The Web](http://coopertype.org/event/typography_on_the_web_sp2022)_ class at [Cooper Union](http://coopertype.org/).

The most fundamental mode of communication on the web is text. Whether we are conscious or unconscious of it, we are all practicing typography when we put text on a page. Understanding both the unique medium of the web and the impact our typographic decisions are critical to communicating with our audiences effectively. In this class you will learn about how text behaves within the fluid medium of the web, along with the tools, techniques, and technologies to ensure typographic excellence.
